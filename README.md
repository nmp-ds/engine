# drive - an UnoCSS preset

## use

## plugin API

### development

- `boolean`
- Internal use only - force preflights(resets.css + transform resets) to be excluded and no externalized classes will be processed

### omitComponentClasses

- `boolean`
- if true forces component classes to be excluded from the process. Styling for the classes already used in component classes won't be generated.

### usePixels

- `boolean`
- Internal use only, for use on sites that are incompatible with root REM/`font-size` changes

## migration development

## checking fabric classes

1. Check out the `parity` project from warp-ds, get dependencies for the project
2. Link to the `parity` project from the `plugin` folder (this folder): `pnpm link ../parity`
3. Run `node checkFabricClasses.js`

## generating warp classes using command line

Run `node dev.js` or `pnpm dev`

Usage: node dev.js [-c <string> | --cliClasses=<string>] [--usePixels] [--development] [--externalClasses] [--externalizeClasses] [--usePreflight]

Example: `node dev.js --usePixels --development --cliClasses=m-2`
! Do not use shortcut when passing negative values, e.g. `node dev.js --cliClasses='-m-2! gap-2'`
